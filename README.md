# Macish Icons
An icon theme for Visual Studio Code drastically inspired by original file icons of Panic's Nova editor.

### Why is it versioned with *0.x.x*?
Currently this icon theme is considered as experimental.
Icons might change, be resized or removed for specific file types to avoid visual cluttering.
